<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Every year VIT HOSTEL
COUNSELLING is held in the second/third week of
March during the Winter Semester for students’ room
reservation for the ensuing academic year. Room
reservation criteria and rules will be purely based on
the academic performance well as the clean chit
record of students’ discipline as per Code of Conduct,
as practiced every year. Simulation of this project will
involve taking the details of the students as inputs,
then the will be stored in respective branches (such as
CSE, ECE, Mechanical etc.). The desired output shall
be a combined list of students from all branches along
with their NCGPA’s followed by a user – friendly
counselling procedure and room allotments.
